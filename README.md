the timer will reduce by 10 seconds.

- The highscore is loaded into a list and it will stay there until the browser cache is deleted.

### Technologies

### Challenges

- This app was challenging as there were a lot of fe

- The most difficult issue were trying make the questions appear and tranistion to each question.

- Also I got a better understand of javascript. I still believe I need to make my logic a little more effcient.
